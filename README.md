## Encrypt or Decrypt ?

You have to know that ENIGBITMOVE was created to encrypt text files such as Source Code, text document and other files storaging data in text format.  
And using it to encrypting files created by other programs (for example ".PDF") will fail...

ENIGBITMOVE allows to select many of files at once but you can choose only one operation encrypt/decrypt in one time.  `For example you can't encrypt one file and decrypt second file at the same time`.
